We will create a private API using node.js runtime (hapi) and package it into containers with the appâ€™s frontend using docker. And then, with the help of cloud build we will use cloud run to deploy the API and the app. We might use Google Cloud Firestore for the database, and cloud storage features like buckets. We might set another configuration like setting up VPC Service Control, IAM for security, etc. To integrate the api backend into the ML we will use fast / flask API, and as for the front end mobile we will use Retrofit to integrate it. This plan may differ later when the capstone project begins.
