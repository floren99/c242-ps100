## Executive Summary / Abstract

High school students frequently experience uncertainty and regret when choosing a college major. This issue arises from:
- **Lack of Self-Awareness:** Limited understanding of their own abilities, interests, and career inclinations.  
- **Insufficient Resources:** Restricted access to accurate information about various majors and inadequate guidance.  
- **Peer Influence and External Pressure:** Decisions often influenced by friends or family, leading to dissatisfaction.

The project aims to create a solution that empowers students to make well-informed decisions by:
- Providing tailored guidance.
- Enhancing access to interest and skill-based assessments.
- Offering comprehensive resources for exploring various career paths.

### Problem Background
Despite the availability of aptitude tests, students often struggle with:
- Accurate self-assessment.
- Misalignment between interests and chosen majors.
- Limited opportunities to explore and understand career possibilities due to constrained school resources.

By addressing these challenges, the solution seeks to reduce impulsive decision-making and foster motivation and satisfaction in academic and career pursuits.
